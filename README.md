# Practice

This repository contains my regular programming practice and concept-based exercises.

The goal of this repository is to build strong fundamentals through consistent practice.

## Structure

= functions/       # Function-based problems and exercises  
= dictionaries/    # Dictionary-related problems 

## Notes
- Code here focuses on clarity and learning, not optimization
- Concepts are added progressively as I learn
- This repository reflects consistency and steady improvement
